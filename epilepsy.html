                    <h3>Understanding Epilepsy</h3>
                    <p>Epilepsy is a serious brain ailment that is a common neurological disorder across the world. It is characterized by abnormal neurological electrical discharges in the brain. Epileptic seizures are among the most widespread positive indications and symptoms of brain disruption, making epilepsy a significant brain condition. Notably, seizures and epilepsy are among the most frequent neurological disorders affecting children and adolescents, with approximately 470,000 children diagnosed in the United States alone.</p>

                    <h3>What is an EEG?</h3>
                    <p>
                        An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive diagnostic test used to record brain waves in real time. Diagnosing a person’s specific seizure type(s) can greatly help in selecting the appropriate treatment and understanding what kind of epilepsy one has. This allows doctors to understand the typical brain activity so that they can observe for anomalies, like a seizure.

                        Results from an EEG test are used along with the description of the seizure (from a bystander or caregiver who may have witnessed the seizure) and a physical and neurological exam to help a physician identify the seizure type as well as the type of epilepsy or syndrome.

                                For every patient experiencing seizures/epilepsy , it is recommended that EEG (Electroencephalography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans be
                                conducted to comprehensively assess their condition and provide an accurate status update. EEG  reports of seizures usually indicate abnormal electrical
                                activity in the brain.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                During a seizure, the EEG may show rhythmic spikes or sharp waves, which indicate excessive neural activation. The pattern and location of these
                                anomalies can aid in diagnosing the kind of seizure and determining the best therapy. EEG reports frequently include data on background brain activity,
                                which can give insight into the patient's general brain function and help in management decisions.

                        EEG signals are separated into α, β, δ and θ spectral components and provide a wide range of frequency components.
                        EEG spectrum contains some characteristic waveforms that fall primarily within four frequency bands as follows: δ(0.5-4 Hz), θ(4-8 Hz), α(8-13 Hz),
                        and β (13- 30 Hz) . EEG data set has acquired different age groups in this study. They are known epileptic with uncontrolled seizures and are admitted to
                        the neurology department of the Medical Faculty Hospital of Dicle University. EEG signals are to ensure the accuracy of diagnosing disease that usually is
                        taken 8-10 hours in the form of records.The EEG signals that are contained by PCI-MIO 16E DAQ card system that provides real time processing and is a data bus
                        of computer, signal processor and personal computer.
