            <h2>What is Epilepsy?</h2>
            <p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. It is diagnosed after a person has 
                experienced two unprovoked seizures, or one unprovoked seizure with a high likelihood of more, unrelated to a specific 
                cause. Seizures manifest as sudden bursts of electrical activity in the brain that can affect appearance or behavior.</p>

            <h2>What is a Seizure?</h2>
            <p>Seizures are sudden surges of abnormal and excessive electrical activity in your brain and can affect how you appear or act.
                Where and how the seizure presents itself can have profound effects.</p>

                    <h2>Symptoms of Epilepsy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Seizures can affect people in different ways, depending on which part of the brain is involved.
                        Possible symptoms include:
                        <ul class="list-item">
                            <li>Uncontrollable jerking and shaking, called a "fit"</li>
                            <li>Losing awareness and staring blankly into space</li>
                            <li>Becoming stiff</li>
                            <li>Strange sensations, such as a "rising" feeling in the tummy, unusual smells or tastes, and a tingling
                                feeling in your arms or legs</li>
                            <li>Collapsing</li>
                            Sometimes you might pass out and not remember what happened.
                        </ul>

                <p>Damon is a 26 year old author, who recently published his debut book 'A Demon's Whispers', where the main antagonist

                <p>Noemi Manser, a Swiss born conceptual artist and muralist, grew up with epilepsy. Her art series ‘Connecting Brains’
