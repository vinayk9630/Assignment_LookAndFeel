                <h2>A Demon's Whispers, a story inspired by Damon Thorley's epilepsy</h2>
                <p>
                    Damon is a 26 year old author, who recently published his debut book 'A Demon's Whispers', where the main antagonist
                    is heavily based from his experience of living with epilepsy. He tells us about his life with epilepsy, everything
                    from dealing with bullying in school, and depression.

                    Noemi Manser, a Swiss born conceptual artist and muralist, grew up with epilepsy. Her art series ‘Connecting Brains’
                    depicts symbolic androgynous faces which she hopes will highlight the importance of uniting individuals and encouraging

                <h2>How epilepsy cost me my dream career</h2>
                <p>
                    Dan was 21 and serving as a medic in the Royal Navy when he was diagnosed with epilepsy. He was devastated to lose his
                    dream job but is determined not to let epilepsy define him. He is now studying nursing at university and has applied
                    to join the police. He hopes his story will help others, particularly those in the armed forces.
